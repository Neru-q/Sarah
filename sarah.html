    From the very first Pinky promise to every playful Mwah, you have been the most beautiful part of my days. You are my light in the dark, my calm in the chaos, and the soft place my heart calls home. No matter how heavy life feels, no matter how lost I get in the rush of responsibilities and struggles, you are always there—steady, unwavering, and so incredibly loving.

        I don’t know if words will ever be enough to show you how much you mean to me. But let me try.
        
        Thank you.
        
        Thank you for being my safe space, for holding my hand through the storms and never letting go, even when I struggle to hold onto myself. Thank you for listening, for understanding, and for loving me in ways that make even my worst days feel bearable. You are the kind of love that heals, the kind of love that stays, and I don’t take a second of that for granted.
        
        There have been moments when I felt lost, overwhelmed, or just plain exhausted—but in those moments, you always remind me of who I am. Whether it’s through your soft words, your gentle presence, or just the way you make me laugh when I need it most, you lift me up in ways no one else ever has.
        
        You are the most selfless, thoughtful, and caring person I have ever known. Even when you're tired, even when life weighs heavy on your shoulders, you still find it in you to check on me, to remind me that I am loved, that I am never alone. You always put me first, even when you don’t have to, even when I wish you’d let yourself rest instead.
        
        And I see it. I see all the love you pour into us. I see how much you care, how much you try, how much you give. I see your heart, and God, it is the most beautiful thing in this world.
        
        I know life hasn’t always been fair to you. I know there are days when you feel unheard, unseen, or like your emotions are too much. But please, my love, listen to me when I say this: You are not too much. You are not selfish. You are not a burden. You are a heart too full for this world, a soul too kind for some to understand. But I understand. I always will.
        
        Loving you isn’t just something I do—it’s something I am honored to do. Because you are everything.
        
        Every Mwah is a promise. Every Promise is a piece of my heart. Every "I love you" carries the weight of forever.
        
        Sarah, you are my always, my forever, my greatest love. And I will never stop choosing you.
        
        Yours, in this life and every life after,
        
        Your dear love
        Sean
